## What I Do

As a Senior Software Engineer - Mobile at SunStrong Management, I lead full-cycle development of mobile solutions that empower SunPower’s solar and storage ecosystem. I architect and deliver user-centric apps that streamline commissioning and monitoring for over 5,000+ field technicians and offer 65,000+ homeowners intuitive control over their energy systems.

- Contributed extensively to **mySunPower**, a customer-facing app that provides real-time insights and system control, improving energy engagement and satisfaction.
- Key engineer behind **ProConnect (CM3)**, developed from the ground up with a modular architecture and reusable design system to accelerate future development.
- Automated mobile DevOps workflows using **Fastlane** and **GitHub Actions**, optimizing builds and enabling consistent releases on both the **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store**.
- Engineered a React Native **Scanner Component** for multi-code scanning, eliminating hardware dependencies and saving ~$150,000 annually.
- Optimized IoT commissioning via **BLE and WiFi**, boosting system efficiency by 20%.
- Collaborated with QA to develop test strategies that reduced production bugs and improved app ratings by 20%.
- Reduced CI pipeline billing minutes by 25% and cut deployment times by 30% through test automation and build optimization.
- Improved firmware update workflows in coordination with hardware teams, decreasing update time and enhancing reliability.
- Modernized legacy **Cordova** applications, improving performance and cutting maintenance time by 25%, facilitating a smoother transition to modern tech.
- Integrated and maintained **GraphQL APIs** to streamline data fetching, reduce over-fetching, and improve mobile and web app performance.
- Contributed to cross-platform consistency by supporting a companion **web application**, ensuring cohesive features and responsive design across web and mobile experiences.
- Implemented **Mixpanel** to monitor user behavior and feature adoption, enabling data-driven decisions that enhanced user engagement and retention.
- Integrated **Sentry** for real-time crash and error tracking, significantly improving incident response times and overall app stability across platforms.

I specialize in building resilient, scalable mobile and web platforms that drive measurable impact and user satisfaction.

## Projects Beyond Work

Outside of my professional role, I actively build and maintain personal and open-source projects that align with my interests in technology and societal impact:

- **Marriage Game Point Calculator**: A cross-platform mobile app used by thousands to score a traditional Nepali card game. Available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marriagecardgamepointcalculator) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mgpc-marriage-point-calculator/id1546733404).
- **Immersive Learning Platform** (in-progress): A web app for education using AI-powered video summarization and MongoDB-backed analytics, part of a broader research initiative.
- **NepalBhasa App**: Collaborated with Dabuli, a US-based nonprofit, to build a platform that hosts a rich Nepalbhasa dictionary and cultural resources aimed at preserving the Newar language. This project reflects my commitment to giving back to my roots and promoting cultural awareness through technology.
- **Hamro Blood Bank**: Developed a solution to help address the critical issue of blood shortage in Nepal by streamlining access to compatible blood donors. This app focuses on saving lives through rapid donor-matching in time-sensitive medical situations.
- **BLE Utilities & Firmware Tools**: Built utilities for scanning, pairing, and secure communication with IoT devices using React Native and AES encryption.
- Regularly contribute to open-source projects and mentor early-stage developers.

These projects reflect my commitment to lifelong learning, community involvement, and technical leadership.
