Unlike other applications, My School Bus is easy to install and maintain. You can easily check in through suggestions to start with the app. Besides that, it reduces the communication gap between parents, students, and schools. This app can also view regulations and tracking records.

Parents can become more involved in their children's travelling, where they can track them by connecting with bus attendants. They can also set the alarms accordingly so that they can reach out to the bus on time and pick up their kid on time. Parents get more self-confident and are more relaxed about their kids. Also the students will be safe and secured without any threat which  they might undergo. Even in some case kids can decide to board their bus from different locations, for certain days, and yes My School Bus makes it possible. Children grow in their own abilities and tend to make better care of them.

While the App helps a lot to parents and students, they are also beneficial for schools. The school can get the track records whenever the children are bored in the bus or drop off. Even during times of delay or absence, this app helps to notify the school with the information easily. Also, the App enables administrators and teachers to spend less time on written recordkeeping. This would also give them more time to focus on other since the digital recordkeeping would reduce time consumption.

The interactive pavement that the App provides can help students,  parents and schools. My School Bus leads to  a high level of comfort to both parents and students since they have access to supervision of transport.

## Key Features

#### Real time GPS tracking
Safety is the topmost concern and priority of parents these days. There are a lot of unexpected dangers that are widespread in the outside world. Every week we hear instances of  a child being kidnapped or gone missing. Even small safety precaution matters so much. A number of student safety issues are related to school bus. Enable the shield of protection through GPS tracking system, a one stop solution for a lot of problems.

Real-time GPS tracking system is a convenient system that can be accessed through your personal computer or mobile phone as it has web application as well as a mobile application. The difficulty of managing school bus timings vanishes by using school bus monitoring system with assured safety alerts.
- Using RFID tags and GPS the real-time updates of the student in school bus is notified to the parents and school authorities by GPS tracking system. Be double sure about the location of your child.
- The software takes care of routing of the school bus, replacing error with accuracy. Time and energy is saved by the system along with re-routing and rescheduling whenever an issue arises.
- School buses remain under the monitoring of school authorities while on road. The school authorities get to know how effectively the bus is being managed by the driver. The speed of the bus is also under surveillance.
- Activity of each vehicle is monitored as well as stored. Working hours is also calculated and stored.
- Manual entering is prone to mistakes and requires ample time and energy
- Helps in school trips, without getting lost
- GPS is cost effective

#### Notification Centre
One of the best parts of our school bus tracking software is the real-time or active notification facility. At a time when most parents would be busy with their jobs, the active notification feature keeps them updated about the various happenings in their child’s school life. When it comes to school bus tracking, real-time notifications provide an additional layer of safety and convenience. 
For instance, a parent who regularly picks up his/her child from the bus stop may not be able to reach the stop in time due to an emergency meeting at office. With the help of active notification, which informs the parent when the child boards the school bus, he/she will be able to arrange another person to pick up the child. 

There might also be situations when the child might get into the wrong bus or miss the bus altogether. Active notifications become quite helpful under such circumstances. No time gets wasted and the child can be tracked down in a short time.

As the student tracking system has a mobile application as well as a web interface, there are active notifications in both. In case a parent does not have access to a smartphone, he or she can get the notifications in the parent portal.

There are a number of instances when parents will get notifications. These include
In the morning,
- 45 minutes prior to the bus given pickup/drop time (Offline Alarm)
- Once the bus reaches the desired set location from the stop
- Once the child boards the school bus or if the child doesn’t board
- In case the bus rides out of route
- When the bus crosses the speed limit
- Once the child alight the school bus

Similarly, in the evening, the whole process takes place again. Convenience is the day to day advantage of getting real-time notifications. The first notification of a day, when the school bus is 45 minutes away from the given pickup/drop time will make parents and children more alert. It will help avoid students missing their school buses. 

But more than convenience, the more important advantage is the added safety. Children stranded at bus stops can be picked up without delay and it gets easier to track students down in case of unfortunate incidents such as kidnapping.

#### Industry Leading Hardware
Any good tracking system is made of equal parts software and hardware. The quality of both elements is vital to the final product, and we realize this. That’s why we use the best and latest GPS tracking device available.

Normal GPS tracking hardware would include two different components. One would include the tracking device which sends out the location signals to the satellite and another one for reading RFID tags. But, the hardware we use is a sleeker, more portable kit which takes up lesser space. It incorporates both the tracking hardware as well as the RFID reader in a single body.
The hardware we use provides numerous advantages to you.
- School Bus Attendance – Unlike normal GPS tracking systems which do not have an attendance function built-in, our system is able to provide attendance facilities to you.
- It enables us to provide notifications to parents when the child boards or alights the school bus.
- The device is physically strong and durable due the use of industry grade materials used in the casing, PCB and the components.
- The quality of GPS devices usually come under scrutiny due to quality issues. We neither use nor recommend china made devices as there are a couple of inconveniences. First is that the maintenance and installation processes are difficult due to the unavailability of local representation of such manufacturers. And the second point is that we like the components to be perfectly in sync with our system.
- Portable design means it’s not really difficult to transport the devices, unlike the GPS trackers of yesteryear. Moreover, the compact dimensions ensure the device occupies minimal space.

Our hardware is made in Nepal by our sister organization Spark Innovation, leader in electromechanical  wing in Nepal. Their devices are known for their accuracy and durability. Combined with the rest of our system, you get an exceptional product that ensures safety for children as well as efficiency for fleet management.

#### Easy Installation and Maintenance
As mentioned earlier, our tracking device is unique. Both RFID reader and GPS technologies are merged into one device. Being a single piece of hardware, it is relatively effortless to install this device in quick time. The quality of hardware ensures there would be minimum maintenance required. And in case there are any issues, our experts are ready to provide any sort of assistance you might require. You would be able to know the status of repair once you login to the web portal.
