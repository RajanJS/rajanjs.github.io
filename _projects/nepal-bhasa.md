## Project Overview

NepalBhasa is a dedicated online platform that not only offers an extensive Nepalbhasa dictionary but also serves as a comprehensive collection of resources aimed at the preservation and promotion of Nepalbhasa, the Newar language.


Being from the same ethnic group **Newar** was willing to help the community back, worked with Dabuli, a US nonprofit company that strengthens Nepal's cultural through research, performances and advocacy. It aims to foster intercultural communities and collaboration while promoting a deeper understanding of the rich music, arts, and traditions of the Himalayan region.

[Nepalbhasa.org](https://www.nepalbhasa.org/) is an online platform and community-led initiative established by Dabuli with the primary objective of preserving and promoting Nepalbhasa, also known as the Newar language. Through this platform, Nepalbhasa.org aims to provide tools, documentation, and educational materials that contribute to the revitalization and continued appreciation of the rich cultural heritage embodied within the Newar language.

Currently the site contains online dictionary with close to 30K words with their meaning, word origin, audio pronunciations, and images. It also contains proverbs, baby names and quiz.
