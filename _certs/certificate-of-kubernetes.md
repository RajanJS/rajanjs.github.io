## Certificate Overview

As part of my ongoing professional development in DevOps and cloud-native architecture, I completed the *Kubernetes for Beginners* course on Udemy. This course offered a practical, beginner-friendly introduction to Kubernetes and container orchestration using real-world examples and hands-on labs.

Topics covered included:

- Kubernetes architecture: nodes, pods, clusters, and the control plane  
- Managing containers using kubectl and YAML manifests  
- Creating and deploying pods, replica sets, and deployments  
- Understanding services, ingress, config maps, and secrets  
- Using Minikube for local development and learning  
- Introduction to persistent storage, resource limits, and autoscaling  
- Troubleshooting and debugging Kubernetes workloads  

This course helped me solidify my foundational understanding of Kubernetes, enabling me to better integrate container orchestration into CI/CD workflows and scalable production systems.
