## Certificate Overview

Originally completed in May 2020 and **retaken in May 2025** to stay aligned with modern React practices, this course helped reinforce and expand on building **enterprise-grade React applications** with the latest tools and architecture.

This course prepared me to build **enterprise-grade React applications** by following advanced design patterns, optimizing performance, and managing state effectively using Redux, Redux Thunk, and Redux Saga.

Key updated topics included:

- Modern React (v18+) with Hooks, Suspense, and Context API
- Advanced state management using Redux Toolkit, Redux Thunk, and Redux Saga
- GraphQL integration for efficient data fetching and API interaction
- Firebase authentication, storage, and serverless architecture
- Stripe payments and converting apps to PWAs
- Component-driven design with styled-components and reusable patterns
- Testing React apps using Jest and snapshot testing

This course reinforced my foundation while aligning me with the **latest trends and architecture choices** expected of a senior React developer.
