## Certificate Overview

This course on **"Node.js: Microservices (2019)"** provided a solid foundation in designing and operating scalable, distributed systems using Node.js. It walked through both **architectural principles** and **hands-on implementations** relevant to real-world systems.

### Key Learnings:

- **Service Registry Setup**: Configured and managed a central registry for service discovery
- **Service Registration/Deregistration**: Implemented mechanisms for lifecycle management of microservices
- **Versioning and Load Balancing**: Explored strategies to manage multiple service versions and distribute traffic efficiently
- **Fault Tolerance**: Used circuit breakers and fallback strategies to improve service resilience
- **Caching**: Introduced caching techniques to enhance performance and reduce load on dependent services
- **Queue Integration**: Integrated message queues in Node.js to decouple services and support async processing (e.g., feedback storage)
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Learned to trace service interactions and identify issues in a microservices environment

By completing this course, I gained practical experience in building reliable and maintainable microservices with **Node.js**, empowering me to architect backend systems that scale with business needs.
