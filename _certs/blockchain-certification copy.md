## Certificate Overview

This intensive crash course, hosted by TechFlowSpace in collaboration with iBriz.AI and BitsBeat, provided a deep dive into the fundamentals and real-world applications of blockchain technology.

Despite my background in software development, this program offered a structured foundation across both theoretical and practical blockchain concepts, including:

- The history and evolution of blockchain (BTC, ETH, ICONLOOP, TRON, EOS)  
- Blockchain types and consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, DPoS, PoA)  
- Key blockchain features: decentralization, trustlessness, distributed ledgers  
- Ethereum blockchain structure, smart contracts, and DApp architecture  
- Hands-on development using Solidity, Truffle, Ganache, Remix, Web3, and MetaMask  
- Real-world use cases: supply chain, identity verification, finance, and UN projects  
- Introduction to Hyperledger and enterprise solutions including Quorum  

The course concluded with a live DApp workshop and exposure to multiple ecosystems, enhancing my ability to integrate blockchain into real-world product development.
