## Certificate Overview

Despite 8+ years of experience as a software engineer, I enrolled in this course to stay sharp and updated with modern mobile development practices. The course focused on building real-world apps using the latest tools in the React Native ecosystem â€” including Expo, Firebase, Redux, and React Navigation.

It covered:

- Creating full-scale iOS and Android apps from scratch  
- Implementing responsive UI and smooth UX patterns  
- Leveraging native device features like camera, maps, and offline storage  
- Using TypeScript, custom hooks, and scalable architecture  
- Debugging, testing, optimizing performance, and publishing apps to app stores  

The certification reinforces my ability to ship performant, cross-platform mobile applications using a modern React Native workflow.
