## Certificate Overview

This project-based course focused on building a fully functional, ChatGPT-style AI chatbot using Nuxt 3, OpenAIâ€™s GPT API, and Tailwind CSS. The hands-on approach allowed me to dive deeper into both frontend and backend aspects of AI application development.

Key learnings included:

- Integrating OpenAI's GPT API with a Nuxt 3 frontend  
- Creating real-time, user-friendly chat interactions  
- Using Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI styling  
- Managing state and token limits efficiently  
- Deploying and securing the chatbot in a production environment  

This certification showcases my ability to implement AI-powered features in a modern web tech stack â€” from API integration to polished user experience.
