## Certificate Overview

This SoloLearn certification marks the beginning of my journey into JavaScript and web development. It introduced core JavaScript fundamentals through interactive lessons and hands-on challenges, laying the groundwork for the frontend and full-stack projects I would later build.

Key topics covered:

- JavaScript syntax, variables, and data types  
- Conditionals, loops, and control structures  
- Functions and scope  
- Arrays and objects  
- Basic DOM manipulation and browser interaction  

Completing this course helped me build a strong programming foundation that Iâ€™ve expanded on over the years in professional and open-source projects.
